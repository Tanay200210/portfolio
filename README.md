### Projects
**Optimal Pricing Strategy for a Local Gym**

Developed a new pricing strategy for a local gym, using primary data collected through surveys. For this project, I surveyed 107 young people in the vicinity of the gym and gathered information on their preferences, expectations, budgets, etc. Personal information, such as names, phone numbers, etc, were not collected. Using insights from Behavioural Economics and using the concept of decoy pricing, a new pricing strategy was proposed. This set of prices was identical to the original set of prices, and had an additional option (the decoy option). The proposed strategy was associated with a revenue increment of over 10%.

Tools used: Excel, and R.

**Intercontinental Analysis of Conflict Data (How Media Freedom is affected by Conflicts)**

For this project, I colleced data from multiple sources, combined them and cleaned and sorted them to prepare for analysis. Using regression analysis, it was shown that political instability and journalist fatalities were crucial in determining media freedom. The data was broken down by years by factoring them using R (to account for intertemporal trands) and was further broken down by continents (I created continental dummies in Excel). The results show that some continents have overall better freedom for journalism while some don't.

Tools used: Excel, R, and Tableau.

**Machine Learning Analysis Project on Gene Expression Data**

I used gene expression dataset to implement classification models. This project was designed to study which classification model yields the best results. First, a PCA (Principal Component Analysis) was done and then models like KNN, Trees (with and without ensemble methods), Logistic Regression, SVM, LASSO, and finally, a Deep Learning Model were implemented. Logistic regression, LASSO, and SVM performed the best. (This was just a casual, learning project).
